## Future Features

Social media links
The thouht is to upload a video on youtube, but it hasn´t been done yet.
When I start the renting, Krokviken will have an own site on fb and instagram and the links will then go direct to those sites.
That can lead to more traffic and the object will get attention to more poople and more revenue for me.

Gallery
